PYTHON OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Next move towards concept & one of the concept is OOPS concept

Python famous cuz fuctional orinetied programin language, do support procedue oriented & object oriented programing language

What is procedure - we call the function inside the function & breakdown the project to small small module.

- What is mean by object -- in real time problem we are trying to solve virtual world solution
- E.g if i want to call anyone i need object which is phone, for type a code need laptop, laptop is object. in real world everything is object
- Every object has certain attribute & certain behaviour
- Attribute ( my weight, ,my name, company which i am working is attribute )
- Behaviour - I am talking, I am explaining (these are behaviour)
- Action defines behaviour.
- Object is something where we can store the data & object will some thing will behaviour.
- Function in object oriented is called  methods
- Any programin language you choose always class & object will together but why
- Company manufacture the mobile phone. many people use the phone  those are the object 
- Phone design is import. 
- Phone design at once & manufacture plenty of phone 
- Desing in oops concept is called CLASS
- CLASS - DESIGN || OBJECT - INSTANCE
- We can called as INSTANCE OF THE CLASS
- Phone is the instance of the class Phone design
- class - blueprint which followed object
- class - design of the object. without design we cant build object
